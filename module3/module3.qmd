# Introduction {#introduction}

*Note: This exercise is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to a real life situation is purely coincidental.*

In December 2020, three cases of primary bloodstream infections sustained by ertapenem-resistant *Klebsiella pneumoniae* were observed over a two-week period in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the University College Hospital in Ibadan, Oyo State. This NICU consists of a 15-bed tertiary level ward. Since the detection of these infections, faecal screening of all admitted neonates was performed. Additionally, ten samples from the environment were collected. The epidemiological and demographic data is summarised in the file [epi_data.csv](data/epi_data.csv).

<br/><br/>

The reference lab sent you the culture results from the faecal, bloodstream, and environmental sampling in an Excel file called ([`lab_results.xlsx`](data/lab_results.xlsx)). Faecal screening of the admitted neonates, revealed that **five other neonates** were carriers of *K. pneumoniae*. Also, the lab reported that **2 out of 10** environmental samples were positive for *K. pneumoniae*. **This immediately prompted the closure of 1 room.**

One colony from each confirmed case and from each of the two positive environmental samples were sent to the GHRU-Ibadan unit for sequencing. 

It is now up to you to investigate the possibility of an outbreak of *K. pneumoniae* in the neonatal unit using the raw sequencing data, the GHRU assembly pipeline, Pathogenwatch, data-flo and Microreact, free web applications developed by the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance for data analyses, integration and visualisation.

# Objectives {#learning-outcomes}

At the end of this session the participants will be able to:

1.  Trim, assemble and QC with GHRU Nextflow pipeline
2.  Obtain high quality assemblies for downstream analysis
3.  Identify and discard low quality genomes
4.  Determine the probable cause of issues during sequencing and assembly

# Trim, assemble and QC with GHRU Nextflow pipeline {#obtain-high-quality-assemblies}

GHRU Nextflow pipeline can be used to process short read fastq files an assembly pipeline using the SPAdes assembler. Alongside this it will QC the reads before and after trimming and QC the final assembled scaffolds file using Quast.
The pipeline was based on Shovill (Thanks to Torsten Seemann @torstenseemann): https://github.com/tseemann/shovill 

This pipeline automates a number of key steps in the complex process of genome assembly. 

## Hardware

For this exercise you will use our pre configured bioinformatics servers. Connecting to our bioinformatics servers ensure the computational resources required for the assembly process are available. If you wish to run through this module on another platform, you will need to install the required software and download the sample data yourself. The pipeline we will be using is available here `https://gitlab.com/cgps/ghru/pipelines/dsl2/pipelines/assembly`. 

To connect to our bioinformatics servers, follow the instructions below. Replace `user` with your username with the name of the server you want to connect to. You will need to enter your password when prompted. Your password will be provided to you by one of the instructors:

```bash
# Connect to the server
ssh user@159.65.95.44
```

## Data

You will find 11 sets of paired-end Illumina reads in the `/data/`. Thus, this directory will contain 22 fastq files (two per genome). You can check the data is actually there:

```bash
# Check the contents of the /data/ directory
ls /data/
```

The `/data` directory will serve as the input directory for the GHRU assembly pipeline. You can practice fetching the data from a remote location such as Figshare, ENA or SRA following the instructions in the [fetching data](#fetching-data)  bonus section.

## Software

The assembly process pipeline will process each pair of Illumina short-read fastq files and assemble them using the [SPAdes assembler](https://github.com/ablab/spades). Along the assembly process, the workflow will perform quality control checks and filters. The workflow consists of the following steps:

- QC reads using FastQC before trimming
- Trim reads using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) and Cutadapt (if `--cutadapt` specified)
- QC reads using [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) after trimming
- Correct reads using lighter
- Check for contamination using confindr
- Count number of reads and estimate genome size using Mash
- Downsample reads if the `--depth_cutoff` argument was specified
- Merge reads using Flash where the insert size is small
- Assemble reads using SPAdes (by default the `--careful` option is turned off)
- Assess species identification using bactinspector
- Assess assembly quality using [QUAST](http://quast.sourceforge.net/)
- Summarise all assembly QCs using [QUAST](http://quast.sourceforge.net/)
- (Optional if QuailFyr qc conditions YAML file is supplied). Filter assemblies into three directories: pass, warning and failure based on QC  metrics

Nextflow is already installed in our bioinformatics servers, and the assembly pipeline can be found in `/opt/ghru-assembly`. Let's check that nextflow is installed and that we can find the assembly pipeline:

```bash
# Check that nextflow is installed
nextflow -v
# Check the assembly pipeline can be found at /opt/ghru-assembly directory
ls /opt/ghru-assembly
```

Nextflow should be preconfigured for you, but if you want to try this on another platform you will need too install `nextflow` and assembly pipeline. You can install them by following the instructions in the [install nextflow](#install-nextflow) or [install pipeline](#install-pipeline) bonus sections.

## Implementation

First we need to create a directory to store the assemblies. We will call this directory `results`. You can create this directory with the following command, replace `user` with your username:

```bash
# Create the results directory
mkdir /workshop/user/results
```

Next, let's create a directory to store the implementation scripts and the working directory. We will call this directory `scripts`. You can create this directory with the following command, replace `user` with your username:

```bash
# Create the scripts directory
mkdir /workshop/user/scripts
```

Now we create a script to run the assembly pipeline. You can create a file called `assembly.sh` in the `scripts` directory using a text editor such as `nano` or `vim`. You can copy and paste the following code into the file and save it:

Please change the output directory in line with your username. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
NEXTFLOW_WORKFLOWS_DIR='/opt/ghru-assembly'
INPUT_DIR='/data'
OUTPUT_DIR='/workshop/user/results'

nextflow run ${NEXTFLOW_WORKFLOWS_DIR}/main.nf \
    --adapter_file adapters.fas \
    --qc_conditions qc_conditions_nextera_relaxed.yml \
    --input_dir ${INPUT_DIR} \
    --fastq_pattern '*{R,_}{1,2}.f*q.gz' \
    --output_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR} \
    --depth_cutoff 100 \
    --prescreen_file_size_check 12 \
    --careful \
    --kmer_min_copy 3 \
    -w ${OUTPUT_DIR}/work \
    -resume
```

Finally, you can run the assembly pipeline by executing the script, replace `user` with your username:

```bash
# Run the assembly pipeline
bash /workshop/user/scripts/assembly.sh
```

## Results

The assembly pipeline will create six directories in the `assemblies` directory, replace `user` with your username. 

```bash
# Check the contents of the /results directory
ls /workshop/user/results
```

You will find the fasta-formatted assemblies in the `assemblies` directory. There, you will find `pass`, `warning`, and `failure` directories containing the assemblies according to their quality. You can check the contents of the `assemblies` directory, replace `user` with your username:

```bash
# Check the contents of the /results/assemblies directory 
ls /workshop/user/results
```

Additonally you will find the `quality_reports` directory containing the quality control reports for the assemblies. You can check the contents of the `quality_reports` directory, replace `user` with your username:

```bash
# Check the contents of the /results/quality_reports directory
ls /workshop/user/results/quality_reports
```

You may want to import the quality report (`results/quality_reports/qualifyr_report.tsv`) to your local machine so as to explore whether the assemblies are of high quality or not. You can use the `scp` command to do this, replace `user` with your username:

```bash
# Copy the quality report to your local machine
scp user@159.65.95.44:/workshop/user/results/quality_reports/qualifyr_report.tsv /path/to/local/machine
```

You will be prompted for your password. You can use the same command to copy the assemblies to your local machine (hint: `scp -r` helps you move an entire directory). 

## Other workflow outputs
There is a great deal of other outputs produced by the pipeline. These will be found in the directory specified by the `--output_dir` argument. In this case, `/workshop/user/results/`

* A directory called fastqc/post_trimming that contans the Fastqc reports for each fastq in html format after trimming
* A directory called assemblies containing the final assembled scaffold files named as <SAMPLE NAME>_scaffolds.fasta. If the qc_conditions argument was given there will be subdirectories named pass, warning and failure where the appropiately QCed scaffolds and failure reasons will be stored.
* A directory called quast containing:
    * A summary quast report named combined_quast_report.tsv
    * A transposed summary quast report with the samples as rows so that they can be sorted based on the quast metric in columns named combined_quast_report.tsv

        * qualifyr_report.html : e.g QualiFyr Report
        * qualifyr_report.tsv
* if the --full_output parameter is given then the following will also be available in the output directory
    * A directory called fastqc/pre_trimming that contans the Fastqc reports for each fastq in html format prior to trimming
    * A directory called corrected_fastqs that contains the fastq files that have been trimmed with Trimmomatic and corrected using Lighter
    * If using paired end reads, a directory called merged_fastqs that contains the fastq files that have been merged using Flash. There will be a files called
        * <SAMPLE NAME>.extendedFrags.fastq.gz merged reads
        * <SAMPLE NAME>.notCombined_1.fastq.gz unmerged read 1 reads
        * <SAMPLE NAME>.notCombined_2.fastq.gz unmerged read 2 reads
