    "text": "Background\nGenomic epidemiology aims to understand the emergence and dissemination of high-risk clones within pathogen populations with the ultimate goal of implementing evidence-based interventions to protect public health. High-risk clones are subpopulations/strains/variants of a pathogen that carry risk elements, such as antibiotic resistance or virulence determinants, and thus pose a potential risk to public health.\nThe increased genetic resolution afforded by genomic data is useful from global to local geographic scales, and has proven to be particularly useful for the investigation of pathogens that exhibit little genetic variation (e.g. Wong et al. 2016), and for outbreak investigations (e.g. Hendriksen et al. 2011, Eppinger et al. 2014). During outbreak investigations (and other genomic epidemiology studies), epidemiological data from patients is collected by healthcare professionals. Antimicrobial susceptibility data, species identification, and any further phenotypic or molecular characterization of the isolates is often generated by the laboratories linked to healthcare facilities and/or by the reference laboratory. Ideally, these different sources of data are stored in a centralised surveillance system and database, such as WHONET. However, these systems rarely incorporate genomic data produced by bioinformaticians. Genomic data may include sequence/assembly quality, genotyping/genoserotyping information, presence/absence of known risk elements, and clustering of the isolates based on genetic similarity –usually in the form of a phylogenetic tree or a minimum spanning-tree.\nThe job of a genomic epidemiologist often starts by combining data from diverse sources that might not be complete or standardised to facilitate the identification of relevant patterns for meaningful interpretation. Once integrated, the epi, lab, and genomic data can be interrogated over the structure of the tree to identify clusters of interest that will place the isolates in or out of the outbreak.\nThe Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance develops free web applications for data collection, integration, visualisation, and analysis of genomic epidemiology data. Epicollect5 is a mobile & web application for free and easy data collection. It provides both the web and mobile applications for the generation of forms (questionnaires) and freely hosted project websites for data collection. Projects are created by using the web application at five.epicollect.net, and then downloaded to the device to perform the data collection. Data are collected in the field using multiple devices and all data can be viewed on a central server (via map, tables, and charts). Data-flo is a system for customised integration and manipulation of diverse data via a simple drag and drop interface. Data-flo provides a visual method to design a reusable pipeline to integrate, clean, and manipulate data in a multitude of ways, eliminating the need for continuous manual intervention (e.g., coding, formatting, spreadsheet formulas, manual copy-pasting). Microreact allows you to upload, visualise and explore any combination of clustering (trees), geographic (map) and temporal (timeline) data. Other metadata variables are displayed in a table. You can specify colours and/or shapes to display on the map, tree and/or timeline. A permanent URL is produced for you to share your Microreact.\n\n\nTargeted competencies and Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes\n\nBioinformatics tools\nFrom fastq to report\nIntegrated skills: Scripting, Visualising, Interpreting\n\n\n\nTraining Methods and Instructional Strategies\n\nDiscussions, hands-on activities\n\n\n\nDuration of training\n\nTwo and half days (17h total)\n\n\n\nResources\nA series of resources will be made available for participants prior, during and after the workshop: tutorials / documentation and printed training materials.\n\n\nRecommended background knowledge\n\nBiological and clinical mechanisms underlying infectious pathogens\nInfectious disease epidemiology and surveillance\nDisease outbreaks\nPathogens of clinical significance\nAntimicrobial resistance\nScripting\nExperience with a Linux environment\nKnowledge on next-generation sequencing"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The importance of Digital Epidemiology\n“Digital epidemiology is epidemiology building on digital data and tools” (Salathé M. et al, Life Sci Soc Policy. 2018)\n\nFunded by the NIHR under the Global Health Research Unit programme, our work at the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance focuses specifically on the applications of digital epidemiology of infectious diseases, including outbreak investigations, pathogen surveillance, understanding of vaccine efficacy and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and vehicles. \nThe importance of digital epidemiology has been raised to a global level during the pandemic. The value of bringing together genomic with epidemiological and clinical data improved public health decision making, informing experts with regard to virus variants expansions and adding significant contributions to the investigation on the origin of the virus. \nMoreover, the pandemic has taught us that the effective use of digital epidemiology can impact on operational decisions in healthcare settings, impacting on patient wellbeing and outcomes.\nDuring the COVID pandemic there has been a learning curve for many laboratories around the world, who were able to use genomic and digital data to good effect, changing operational approaches and decisions based on results. However, interdisciplinary teams formed of wet-lab scientists, Bioinformaticians, clinicians and non-technical staff (hospital managers, for example) often found barriers in communication of information. The relevance and impact of Digital Epidemiology was often difficult to explain between different professional specialisations. Scientists familiar with Digital Epidemiology often found it challenging to communicate to colleagues what genomic data could and could not reveal. \nThere is a general need to learn how to interpret information related to Digital Epidemiology and to better communicate results to various stakeholders."
